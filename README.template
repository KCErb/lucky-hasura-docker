# PROJECT_NAME

This is a project written using [Lucky Hasura Docker](https://github.com/KCErb/lucky-hasura-docker).

### Setting up the project

This project will be ready to use in development and production once set up properly. The development setup is pretty quick but the production setup takes some work. For both, please be sure to follow the README in the [Lucky Hasura Docker repo]](https://github.com/KCErb/lucky-hasura-docker)

1. Run `script/up` to bring up the dev services in Docker.
1. Run `script/test` to bring up some test containers in parallel.
1. Develop to your heart's content.
1. Commit and push code to your `staging` branch to deploy to your staging server.
1. Commit and push code to your `master` branch to deploy to your production server.

If any of the above doesn't work, please double check that you followed and understood the instructions in the [lucky-hasura-docker README]](https://github.com/KCErb/lucky-hasura-docker). If something is still amiss, please file a bug to get some discussion going!
